5. Rent your datakeeper ID 

Congratulations!!! 
</br> Now you can start your datakeeper, send your first proofs and earn $TBY and $TBYmined as a reward.
</br> See the installation guide [here](installation.md).

#### 🪙 Withdraw $TBYmined to $DE token
- use to influence protocol parameters in [Consensus](https://consensus.denet.app/#welcome_to_consensus)
- Use it for your own fate

#### 🪙 Earn $TBY as a system reward from protocol 
- use it for storing data
- Soon: convert it to $TBYmined using charity proofs. Read how it will work [here](https://medium.com/denetpro/denet-storage-protocol-v3-to-address-key-challenge-of-decentralization-f19b9041b0fa#:~:text=close%20the%20deposit.-,Charity%20Proof,-%3A%20The%20DeNet)

### Please....
#### ❗️ Make sure you always have enough $MATIC on yur balance, in order to send proofs.

#### ❗️ Also don't let your $TBY balance become less than your Datakeeper ID, unless you want to get rewards, and shutdown your node.
